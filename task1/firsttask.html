        <h3><b>Reyna</b></h3>
        <p>Reyna is the first Valorant character to be added to the roster since the game’s official launch.

            She’s a vampire whose abilities feed off of getting kills (assists don’t count!), allowing Reyna to heal,
            gain buffs, and even turn invisible.

            Her playstyle is very feast or famine as she only has one ability that doesn’t need to use kills to activate
            it.</p>
